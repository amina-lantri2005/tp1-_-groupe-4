the obtained results show a linear relationship between the concentration and the absobance
small deviations may be due to experimental errors such as imprecise pipetting or impurities in the solutions 
small deviations from perfect linearity may result from experimental uncertainties such as slight inaccuracies in pippeting impurities in the samples or instrumental drift 
this confirms that the beer-lambert law is respected
