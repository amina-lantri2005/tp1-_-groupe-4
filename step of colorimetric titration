#Steps of colorimetric titration (summary):
1. Fill the burette with the solution of known concentration.
2. Put the unknown solution in the conical flask + a few drops of a color indicator.
3. Add the solution from the burette slowly until the color changes (end point).
4. Record the volume used from the burette.
5. 5. Calculate the concentration using the formula:
C_1V_1 = C_2V_2
