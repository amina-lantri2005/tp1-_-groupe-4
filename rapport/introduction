# introduction 
in this tp we study colorimetric calibration.the goal is to understand the main concept and to verify theoretical predictions with exprimental measurement
## material and equipment 
_ colorimeter 
_ test tubes
_ pipettes
_ standard solution of known concentration 
_ distilled water
_ burette 
_ flask
### methods 
1.prepare a set of standard solution wwith known concentration.
2.measure the absorbance of each solutionusing the colorimeter.
3.plot the calibration curve (absorbance vs . concentration ).
4.use the cuver to determine the concentration of the unknown sample.
